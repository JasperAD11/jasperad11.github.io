  <h2>Basketball Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Every time I step on the court, time disappears. I’m fully there — heart racing, mind sharp, body in motion. It’s the competition, the team dynamic, the workout, and the unexplainable joy of just playing. I’ve felt this way since I started organized basketball at age 5 — and it’s never left me.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2023, while working at BEAT81, I met Mikel and Tristen — two fellow basketball fanatics. We’d play pickup games after work in Berlin on a rough court, but we didn’t care. The love for the game made everything else irrelevant. I moved to Lisbon and found the same story again — bad court, sunset light fading, bodies aching, but no one wanted to stop. That’s what the game does to you. It pulls you into flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out of this passion came a vision: to build a basketball space for everyone. Not just another court — a community hub built on love for the game. Imagine a vibrant court with great energy, music, culture, and people. Add-ons like cardio workouts or bodyweight training make it accessible to those who want to hoop *and* stay fit. Combine basketball with general movement and create a space where time is meant to be lost — on purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    We imagine a place that fuses basketball with creativity: hip hop, black culture, inclusivity, swag, music, movement. A playground for adults who want to play like kids — and kids who want to dream like pros. This idea is evolving, growing, and ready for collaborators who believe in its soul.
  </p>
  <p><em>At its core: love for basketball, community, and the kind of joy that makes you forget what time it is.</em></p>
